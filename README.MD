# Course Work

This repository contains my personal course work done during under-graduate studies as a part of partial fulfilment of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering) degree. 

Primarily, it contains the source codes to various programs done as a part of assignments, class and laboratory work. The content has been organised course-wise and uses course codes to identify the different courses.
